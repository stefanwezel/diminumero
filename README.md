[![Python 3.12+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.12+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

An interactive web application to practice number translations in multiple languages. "diminumero" is Spanish for "say my number". Built with Flask, featuring 1,000 numbers per language from basic digits to millions with weighted random selection that prioritizes smaller numbers for effective learning.

**Currently supported languages:** Spanish, German, French (Nepalese in progress)

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-Language Support**: Practice numbers in Spanish, German, and more (see [Adding Languages](ADDING_LANGUAGES.md))
- **1,000 Numbers Per Language**: From 1 to millions with correct grammar for each language
- **Smart Weighting**: Step-wise probability by order of magnitude - numbers <100 have baseline probability, 100-999 are 10× less likely, 1000-9999 are 100× less likely, etc.
- **Three Quiz Modes**: Easy (multiple choice), Advanced (text input with live validation), and Hardcore
- **Bilingual UI**: Interface available in English and German
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Use keys 1-4 for quick answer selection

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or pip

### Installation
Clone and setup the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:stefanwezel/diminumero.git && cd diminumero && uv sync
```

### Run the Application
Start the Flask development server with:
```bash
uv run flask --app app run --debug
```
Access the application at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

### Testing Code
You can trigger local tests with:
```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Run Production Setup with Docker
Before you start with a docker setup, make sure to setup a `.env` file. Have a look at the `.env.example` for reference. To start the production container, run
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
```
Access the application at http://127.0.0.1:5005.

## 🎯 How It Works

### Easy Mode (Multiple Choice)
1. **Start Quiz**: Select a language and click to begin
2. **Answer Questions**: Select the correct translation from 4 options
3. **Get Instant Feedback**: Toast notifications confirm correctness
4. **Track Progress**: See your score and progress bar throughout
5. **Review Results**: View final score with performance feedback

### Advanced Mode (Text Input)
1. **Start Quiz**: Select a language and click to begin
2. **Type Your Answer**: Enter the translation manually
3. **Live Validation**: Get real-time word-by-word feedback as you type
4. **Track Progress**: See your score and progress bar throughout
5. **Review Results**: View final score with performance feedback

### Hardcore Mode
Same as Advanced mode but with stricter validation requirements for an extra challenge.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Backend**: Flask 3.1+
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with responsive design
- **Number Generation**: Algorithmic grammar rules per language

## 📝 Regenerating Numbers

Each language has its own number generator. To regenerate numbers for a specific language:

```bash
python languages/<lang_code>/generate_numbers.py  # e.g., es, de, fr
```

This creates a fresh `numbers.py` in the respective language directory with proper translations.

## 🎨 Customization

- **Quiz Length**: Modify `QUESTIONS_PER_QUIZ` in `app.py` (default 10 questions)
- **Number Weighting**: Adjust order-of-magnitude thresholds and weights in `quiz_logic.py` (currently 10x reduction per magnitude)
- **Colors**: Update color variables in `static/css/style.css`

## 🤝 Contribution

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Branch from an Issue

Before implementing a feature, create a branch from the corresponding GitHub issue.

Pull latest changes:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

Create a feature branch (use issue number and short description)
```bash
git switch -c 6-your-issue-name
```

### 2. Implement and Test Your Changes

Make your changes and ensure everything works:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Run the development server to manually test
```bash
uv run flask --app app run --debug
```
Access at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Before committing, format your code with the project formatter:

```bash
uv run ruff format .
```

**Important**: Add or update tests if you're introducing new functionality. Ensure all tests pass before proceeding.

### 3. Commit and Create a Pull Request

Write descriptive commit messages and reference issue numbers for automatic closing:

```bash
git commit -m "Fix: description of what you changed (Closes #6)"
git push origin 6-your-issue-name
```

Go to GitHub and create a pull request. Update the README and CLAUDE.md if adding new features.

### 4. Test with Production Setup

Before merge, verify your changes work in production:

```bash
# Build and start the production container
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build

# Access at http://127.0.0.1:5005
```

Ensure everything works correctly in the production environment before requesting final review.
